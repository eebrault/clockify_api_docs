# API Docs (Deprecated)

Deprecated API documentation for [Clockify](https://clockify.me) time tracker. 

We strongly recommend using the [stable v1 API](https://clockify.me/developers-api). Stable end points are guaranteed to not change in incompatible ways, so you can be sure that the basic interface as documented by the spec will continue to work as described.

If you need more endpoints and actions, feel free to use the [working API](https://clockify.github.io/clockify_api_docs/).
